## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/skywars.jpg)

I'm learning how to develop plugins for Minecraft so here is my very first Skywars plugin that I created

Here's why:

* a starter kit
* A scoreboard that gives information about the game
* A world regeneration once the game is over

It's still a very light plugin with few features but the plugin works quite well.

You will be notified by new updates in a few time

## Built With

The plugin has been developed with the spigot api for most of the game options and the Luckperms api to get useful information for the ScoreBoard. The whole project is developed in JavaHere are a few examples.

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/TakeMyTrinity/SkyWarsPlugin/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
